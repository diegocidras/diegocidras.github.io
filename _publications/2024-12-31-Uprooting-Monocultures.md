## Abstract

In this chapter, we engage with a particular rural initiative in the periphery of the Global North: the daily struggle of some communities in rural Galicia, in north-western Spain, to (literally) uproot the eucalyptus and acacia trees that grow and expand in their communal lands. First, we will briefly describe how tree plantations expanded at the expense of the forest commons in rural Galicia; next, we introduce how the recent grassroot experience of the “De-eucalyptising Brigades” (Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras in Galician language) is seeking to uproot both physically and symbolically the culture associated to the tree monocultures in the area.
