Hi! I'm a geographer with a particular interest in understanding nature-culture interactions in the management of contentious landscapes. [My research] (https://investigacion.usc.gal/investigadores/844832/detalle) typically draws on social movements and environmentalism, focusing on how collective actions influence social-ecological transformations. Therefore my interests are focused on how grassroots organizing within or beyond the non-profit sector drives struggles for justice and fosters alternative rural and urban geographies. The forestry sector has been a central focus of my analysis, particularly around the role of large eucalyptus plantations in Spain and Western Australia. Awarded the Extraordinary Doctoral Prize in 2024, my [doctoral thesis](https://minerva.usc.es/entities/publication/4ef3d3fb-820c-4d83-bf05-1f6423c6595b) formulates an approach to disputed forest spaces through landscape-scale planning. My work has been published, among others, in _Political Geography_, _Journal for Nature Conservation_, _Australian Geographer_, _Review of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Studies_ and _Bulletin of the Spanish Association of Geography_.

My interests extend to other areas of Geography, such as mobility, geopolitics, inequality, and international cooperation. I am also passionate about maps and open-source GIS. I have primarily carried out my [teaching duties] (https://www.usc.gal/gl/departamento/xeografia/directorio/diego-cidras-fernandez-358206) at the University of Santiago de Compostela, where, during the 2024/2025 academic year, I am teaching undergraduate and masterâ€™s courses, including _Human Geography I_ and _II_ (G3053102, G3053107), _GIS for Regional Human Geography_ (G3052224), _Nature Conservation, Development, and Community Relations_ (MP0170203), and _Sustainable Urban Systems_ (P4241205).
